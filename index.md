## What I can do and why

I'm able to speak Spanish (since it's my mother toungue), English up to a C1 level (title I was granted by Cambridge last June),
and I can stablish a middle-level conversation in French as well.

My knowledge involves informatic systems due to my years studying a network administration degree.

In addition, I coursed a science "Bachillerato", what reveals my knowledge in math, physics and chemistry.
